library(readr)
accident_2017 <- read_csv("2017.csv")
accident_2018 <- read_csv("2018.csv")

df1 <- df %>% group_by(STATENAME, YEAR) %>% filter(VEH_NO == 1 & ST_CASE %% 2 == 0) #add & ST_CASE %% 2 == 0
```
```{r, warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
colnames(df1)

```


Saving the final dataset to 'master.csv'

```{r, warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
write.csv(df1, 'master.csv')
```


## Discription of Data
The data we chose to work with is from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The administration has a system called FARS or the Fatality Analysis Reporting System in which vehicle crashes are noted. The data is comprised from police reports, death certificates, various medical reports, and department data. We chose to look at the years from 2017-2021 for our report. 
```{r, warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
library(readr)
master <- read_csv('master.csv')
head(master)

```

# Research Goals and Questions

The goal of the project is to explore the data set to better understand vehicle crashes. Understanding this topic better can lead to increased awareness, targeted policing efforts, and identification of common trends for accidents. Ultimately, the goal is the circumstances in which individuals get into vehicular accidents, and how to avoid fatal crashes.

In pursuit of the stated goal, we will explore the following questions:

1. Does impairment affect fatality in crashes overall? When are impaired crashes most likely?

2. What regions of the United States have the most fatal crashes? What conditions are present in those regions?

3. How does the demographics of the driver affect crashes? Are changes based on occupants more prevalent for younger drivers?

4. Are crashes affected by lighting and road conditions? How so, and what conditions are most impact? 

5. When are crashes most likely? Are there any seasonal effects, and are night crashes more likely than in the morning or afternoon?

6. How is speeding related to the number of fatalities? Are younger drivers more prone to speeding? Is higher speeding limits associated with more fatalities?


### When are crashes most likely? Are there any seasonal effects, and are night crashes more likely than in the morning or afternoon?

```
```{r}
df %>% group_by(MONTH) %>% summarise(count = sum(FATALS)) %>% arrange(desc(count))
```

```{r}
farb <- c("#4100f3", "#1e00ff", "#5700e7", "#6900d9", "#dd00de", "#d3007f", "#c80028", "#ce0053", "#d900ae", "#c91e1e", "#b500e4", "#8a00e9")

plot_names <- c('1' = "January",
                '2' = "February",
                '3' = "March",
                '4' = "April",
                '5' = "May",
                '6' = "June",
                '7' = "July",
                '8' = "August",
                '9' = "September",
                '10' = "October",
                '11' = "November",
                '12' = "December")

master %>% group_by(DAY) %>% ggplot(aes(x = DAY, weight = FATALS)) + geom_bar(aes(fill = factor(MONTH, levels = c("10","7","8","6","9","5","11","12","4","3","1","2"))))+ facet_wrap(~MONTH, labeller = as_labeller(plot_names)) +geom_hline(yintercept = 200, color='RED') + theme(legend.position="bottom") + scale_fill_manual(values= farb)+ theme( legend.position="right")+labs(fill='Monthly Fatalities') + ylab("Fatalities") + ggtitle("Fatalities by Day and Month")
```
Originally showed same pattern for every month.
Originally showed high in January and Feburary and low for rest of year.


```{r}
df1 %>% ggplot(aes(x = MONTH)) + geom_histogram()
```

It appears that fatal crashes occur the most in the beginning of the year, and decrease heavily until December for all of the years.

```{r}
df1 %>% ggplot(aes(x = HOUR)) + geom_histogram(bins = 100) + ylab("Fatalities") + ggtitle("Fatalities by Hour")
df1 %>% filter(HOUR >24)
df1 %>% filter(HOUR <= 24) %>% ggplot(aes(x = as.factor(HOUR), weight = FATALS)) + geom_bar() + ylab("Fatalities") + ggtitle("Fatalities by Hour") + xlab("HOUR")
```

```{r}
summary(df1$FATALS)
```



```{r}
df1 %>% ggplot(aes(x = as.factor(DAY_WEEK), weight = FATALS)) + geom_bar() + scale_x_discrete(
                      labels=c("Sunday","Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday","Thursday","Friday", "Saturday")) + xlab("Weekday") + ylab("Fatalities") + ggtitle("Fatalities by Weekday")
```

There is a strange outlier with hour, so I will remove that.

```{r}
df1 %>% filter(HOUR <=24) %>% ggplot(aes(x = HOUR)) + geom_histogram() + scale_x_continuous(name="Hour", limits=c(0, 24))
```
It appears that the peak is around 17:00 military time, which is 5pm. Thus, crashes appear to be increasingly likely as the day goes on, peaks at 5pm, and has a minimum at around 4pm.

### How is speeding related to the number of fatalities? Are younger drivers more prone to speeding? Is higher speeding limits associated with more fatalities?



### Does impairment affect fatality in crashes overall? When are impaired crashes most likely?

```{r}
master$ImpairmentAlcohol <- ifelse(master$DRINKINGNAME %in% c("No (Alcohol Not Involved)", "Unknown (Police Reported)", "Not Reported", "Reported as Unknown"), FALSE, TRUE)

master$ImpairmentDrugs <- ifelse(master$DRUGSNAME %in% c("No (drugs not involved)", "Unknown (Police Reported)", "Not Reported", "Reported as Unknown"), FALSE, TRUE)

master <- master %>% mutate(
  Impairment = as.logical(pmax(ImpairmentDrugs, ImpairmentAlcohol))
)

master %>% ggplot(aes(x = Impairment)) + geom_bar()

```

```{r}
master %>% filter(Impairment == TRUE) %>%
  filter(HOUR <=24) %>% ggplot(aes(x = HOUR), fill = factor(MONTH)) + geom_bar(bins = 24)
```





### What regions of the United States have the most fatal crashes? What conditions are present in those regions?

```{r}
master <- master %>% 

  mutate(Region = case_when( 

    STATENAME %in% c("Connecticut", "Maine", "Massachusetts", "New Hampshire", "Rhode Island", "Vermont", "District of Columbia", "New Jersey", "New York", "Pennsylvania") ~ "Northeast", 



    STATENAME %in% c("Illinois", "Indiana", "Iowa", "Kansas", "Michigan", "Minnesota", "Missouri", "Nebraska", "North Dakota", "Ohio", "South Dakota", "Wisconsin") ~ "Midwest", 



    STATENAME %in% c("Alabama", "Arkansas", "Delaware", "Florida", "Georgia", "Kentucky", "Louisiana", "Maryland", "Mississippi", "North Carolina", "Oklahoma", "South Carolina", "Tennessee", "Texas", "Virginia", "West Virginia") ~ "South", 



    STATENAME %in% c("Alaska", "Arizona", "California", "Colorado", "Hawaii", "Idaho", "Montana", "Nevada", "New Mexico", "Oregon", "Utah", "Washington", "Wyoming") ~ "West", 

    TRUE ~ "Other" 

  )) 

master %>% ggplot(aes(x = Region)) + geom_bar()
head(master)

```
