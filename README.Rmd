Here is the link to all of the csv files we used: https://www.nhtsa.gov/file-downloads?p=nhtsa/downloads/FARS/

Importing the accident datasets.
```{r}
library(readr)
accident_2017 <- read_csv("2017.csv")
accident_2018 <- read_csv("2018.csv")
accident_2019 <- read_csv("2019.csv")
accident_2020 <- read_csv("2020.csv")
accident_2021 <- read_csv("2021.csv")
```

```{r}

vehicle_2019$YEAR = 2019
vehicle_2020$YEAR = 2020
vehicle_2021$YEAR = 2021
```

Merging the datasets.
```{r}
df_2017 <- left_join(accident_2017, person_2017, by=c('YEAR', 'ST_CASE'))
df_2018 <- left_join(accident_2018, person_2018, by=c('YEAR', 'ST_CASE'))
df_2019 <- left_join(accident_2019, person_2019, by=c('YEAR', 'ST_CASE'))
df_2020 <- left_join(accident_2020, person_2020, by=c('YEAR', 'ST_CASE'))
df_2021 <- left_join(accident_2021, person_2021, by=c('YEAR', 'ST_CASE'))


df_2017 <- left_join(df_2017, vehicle_2017, by=c('YEAR', 'ST_CASE', 'VEH_NO'))

```

Creating one dataset with all years.
```{r}
df <- bind_rows(df_2017, df_2018,df_2019,df_2020,df_2021)
df1 <- df %>% group_by(STATENAME, YEAR) %>% filter(VEH_NO == 1 & ST_CASE %% 2 == 0) #add & ST_CASE %% 2 == 0
```
```{r}
colnames(df1)
df1 <- df1 %>% select(-one_of('...22', '...21'))
```


Saving the final dataset to 'master.csv'

```{r}
write.csv(df1, 'master.csv')
```


## Discription of Data
The data we chose to work with is from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The administration has a system called FARS or the Fatality Analysis Reporting System in which vehicle crashes are noted. The data is comprised from police reports, death certificates, various medical reports, and department data. We chose to look at the years from 2017-2021 for our report. 
```{r}
master <- read_csv('master.csv')
head(master)

```

# Research Goals and Questions

The goal of the project is to explore the data set to better understand vehicle crashes. Understanding this topic better can lead to increased awareness, targeted policing efforts, and identification of common trends for accidents. Ultimately, the goal is the circumstances in which individuals get into vehicular accidents, and how to avoid fatal crashes.

In pursuit of the stated goal, we will explore the following questions:

1. Does impairment affect fatality in crashes overall? When are impaired crashes most likely?

2. What regions of the United States have the most fatal crashes? What conditions are present in those regions?

3. How does the demographics of the driver affect crashes? Are changes based on occupants more prevalent for younger drivers?

4. Are crashes affected by lighting and road conditions? How so, and what conditions are most impact? 

5. When are crashes most likely? Are there any seasonal effects, and are night crashes more likely than in the morning or afternoon?

6. How is speeding related to the number of fatalities? Are younger drivers more prone to speeding? Is higher speeding limits associated with more fatalities?


### When are crashes most likely? Are there any seasonal effects, and are night crashes more likely than in the morning or afternoon?

```{r}
master %>% group_by(YEAR) %>% ggplot(aes(x = YEAR, weight = FATALS)) + geom_bar() + ggtitle("Fatalities Over Last 5 Years") + ylab("Fatalities") + xlab("Year")
```
```{r}
df %>% group_by(MONTH) %>% summarise(count = sum(FATALS)) %>% arrange(desc(count))
```


```{r}
farb <- c("#4100f3", "#1e00ff", "#5700e7", "#6900d9", "#9100ac", "#a70085", "#ba004d", "#b1006d", "#9d009a", "#c30004", "#8500bc", "#7800cb")
farb <- c("#4100f3", "#1e00ff", "#5700e7", "#6900d9", "#dd00de", "#d3007f", "#c80028", "#ce0053", "#d900ae", "#c91e1e", "#b500e4", "#8a00e9")

plot_names <- c('1' = "January",
                '2' = "February",
                '3' = "March",
                '4' = "April",
                '5' = "May",
                '6' = "June",
                '7' = "July",
                '8' = "August",
                '9' = "September",
                '10' = "October",
                '11' = "November",
                '12' = "December")

master %>% group_by(DAY) %>% ggplot(aes(x = DAY, weight = FATALS)) + geom_bar(aes(fill = as.factor(MONTH))) + facet_wrap(~MONTH, labeller = as_labeller(plot_names))+geom_hline(yintercept = 200, color='RED') + theme(legend.position="bottom") + scale_fill_manual(values= farb)
```

```{r}
df1 %>% ggplot(aes(x = MONTH)) + geom_histogram()
```

It appears that fatal crashes occur the most in the beginning of the year, and decrease heavily until December for all of the years.

```{r}
df1 %>% ggplot(aes(x = HOUR)) + geom_histogram(bins = 100)
```

```{r}
summary(df1$FATALS)
```



```{r}
df1 %>% ggplot(aes(x = as.factor(DAY_WEEK), weight = FATALS)) + geom_bar() + scale_x_discrete(
                      labels=c("Sunday","Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday","Thursday","Friday", "Saturday")) 
```

There is a strange outlier with hour, so I will remove that.

```{r}
df1 %>% filter(HOUR <=24) %>% ggplot(aes(x = HOUR)) + geom_histogram() + scale_x_continuous(name="Hour", limits=c(0, 24))
```
It appears that the peak is around 17:00 military time, which is 5pm. Thus, crashes appear to be increasingly likely as the day goes on, peaks at 5pm, and has a minimum at around 4pm.

### How is speeding related to the number of fatalities? Are younger drivers more prone to speeding? Is higher speeding limits associated with more fatalities?



### Does impairment affect fatality in crashes overall? When are impaired crashes most likely?

```{r}
master$ImpairmentAlcohol <- ifelse(master$DRINKINGNAME %in% c("No (Alcohol Not Involved)", "Unknown (Police Reported)", "Not Reported", "Reported as Unknown"), FALSE, TRUE)

master$ImpairmentDrugs <- ifelse(master$DRUGSNAME %in% c("No (drugs not involved)", "Unknown (Police Reported)", "Not Reported", "Reported as Unknown"), FALSE, TRUE)

master <- master %>% mutate(
  Impairment = as.logical(pmax(ImpairmentDrugs, ImpairmentAlcohol))
)

master %>% ggplot(aes(x = Impairment)) + geom_bar()

```

```{r}
master %>% filter(Impairment == TRUE) %>%
  filter(HOUR <=24) %>% ggplot(aes(x = HOUR), fill = factor(MONTH)) + geom_bar(bins = 24)
```





### What regions of the United States have the most fatal crashes? What conditions are present in those regions?

```{r}
master$West <- ifelse(master$STATENAME %in% c("Alaska", "Arizona", "California","Colorado", "Hawaii", "Idaho", "Montana", "Nevada", "New Mexico", "Oregon", "Utah", "Washington", "Wyoming"), "West", NA)

  
master$NorthEast <- ifelse(master$STATENAME %in% c("Connecticut", "Maine", "Massachusetts", "New Hampshire", "Rhode Island", "Vermont", "New Jersey", "New York", "Pennsylvania"), "NorthEast", NA)

master$South <- ifelse(master$STATENAME %in% c("Alabama", "Arkansas", "Delaware", "Florida", "Georgia", "Kentucky", "Louisiana", "Maryland", "Mississippi", "North Carolina", "Oklahoma", "South Carolina", "Tennessee", "Texas", "Virginia", "West Virginia"), "South", NA)

master$MidWest <- ifelse(master$STATENAME %in% c("Illinois", "Indiana", "Iowa", "Kansas", "Michigan", "Minnesota", "Missouri", "Nebraska", "North Dakota", "Ohio", "South Dakota", "Wisconsin"), "MidWest", NA)

master <- master %>% mutate(
  Region = as.logical(pmax(NorthEast, West, South, MidWest))
)

```
